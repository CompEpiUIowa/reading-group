# AlgoEpi reading group webpage

This is the github repository that contains files used to host the [reading group webpage](https://compepiuiowa.github.io/reading-group/).

The webpage is built on top of [Just the Class](https://github.com/kevinlin1/just-the-class), which again, is built on top of [Just the Docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs). See documentations of those repos for details.

## Instructions on updating the AlgoEpi reading group webpage 
 
- Step 1: Clone the repo to local 
- Step 2: Make changes, commit the changes, then push the changes. Then the webpage will be updated within a few minutes. 

## Updating announcements 

Folder: `_announcements/`

You'll find a template which is `week-0.md`. If creating an announcement for week 1, copy `week-0.md` to `week-1.md`, then, modify the contents accordingly.

## Updating members

Folder: `_staffers/`

Copy the existing markdown file and create a new file if a new member joins the group. I've created 3 roles: `Instructor`, `student`, `former_student`, so use one of these 3 roles properly, then the member will show up in the designated category. If you need more categories, or want to change how they show up in the webpage, modify `staff.md`.

NOTE: You can link a photo to each member. Save the photo under `assets/images/`.

## Update schedule

File: `about.md`

Use any markdown file under `prev_schedules/` as a template to create a schedule markdown for the current semester. I (Hankyu) had saved the previous schedules under the folder `prev_schedules/` from 2021 Fall semester.

## Update the main page

File `index.md`

Modify this file.
