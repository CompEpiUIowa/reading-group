By Prof. Pemmarjau:

-Bijaya and I were thinking that it might be helpful to meet in person because it will be easier to discuss technical stuff with math equations/expressions. Also, it may be easier for the new students to get to know the rest of us. However, we will meet in person only if *all* of us are comfortable doing so. If any of you feel uncomfortable meeting in person at this time, please let us know. If we don't hear from anyone by Monday, we'll assume that we'll meet in person. In that case, we'll need to reserve a room.

-For our meeting on Wed, please try to identify a few recent papers of interest to you within the general theme of algorithms/data mining/ML techniques applied to problems in infection-spread. Recent instances of KDD, SDM, ASONAM, ICML, ICDM, NuerIPS, etc. are good candidates. This is mainly an assignment for Hankyu and Hasib, but Jeff and David, please feel free to contribute. Bijaya and I will also come with a few suggestions.

-Also, one more important homework assignment: we need a nice name for our reading group! Please bring some ideas on Wed.
